### Use Case #2

Name: Promise constructor rejecting and then resolving or vice versa (or with sync errors)

Nitzan is writing code with Promises. He is writing the following function, but it doesn't work as expected.

```js
function promisifyThing(thing) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        if (thing.isAThing) { resolve(thing); }
        if (thing.hasErrors) { reject(thing.accumulatedErrors); }
        if (thing.shouldDoAThing) { thing.doAThing((err, value) => err ? reject(err): resolve(value)); }
    })
}
```

### What happens

In the case that `thing` is both `isAThing` and `hasErrors`, the errors get swallowed. 

### Why it happens

When `resolve()` gets called, any further calls to `reject()` or `resolve()` are ignored. The same is true for `resolve(); throw new Error()`.

Nitzan should have called either `resolve()` or `reject()`, not both, and only one time.

### What can we maybe do better

Provide a clear warning when `resolve()` or `reject()` are called more than once in a Promise constructor.
