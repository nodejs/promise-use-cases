# promise-use-cases

Short lived repository in order to discuss Node.js promise use cases in Collaborator Summit Berlin 2018

### Contributing

Please consider PRing in things that are confusing with promises right now or are done better in userland. I will present the results (with your name and contribution) to Node.js core.

The goal is to provide feedback to Node.js and V8 in order to possibly expose APIs to add capabilites. The goal is explicitly not to address things that can be done in userland. 

**No prior Node.js contribution experience required**. If you're a user of promises and thing we should do things better - we would love to hear about your use case.

### Code of Conduct

This repository - as short lives as it may be is part of the Node.js foundation and is bound by the Node.js [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
